# GUI---Sentiment-Analyzer

This GitHub repository shows how we build our Sentiment Analyzer app step by step. This app consists of supervised and unsupervised models like TextBlob, VADER, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest to predict sentiment. It also allow the user to: import, analyze, and download csv files containing sentiment and performance metrics between models.

This app was created using Google Colab, Python and Streamlit.

You can use "Spotify.csv" and "movie_reviews.csv" to test the app. 

You can find both of these csv files in "Releases" section for download and testing.
