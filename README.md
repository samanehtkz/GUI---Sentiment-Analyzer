# GUI---Sentiment-Analyzer

This GitHub repository shows how we built our Sentiment Analyzer app step by step. This app consists of supervised and unsupervised models like TextBlob, VADER, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest to predict sentiment. It also allows the user to: import, analyze, and download csv files containing sentiment and performance metrics between models.

This app was created using Google Colab, Python and Streamlit.

You can find "Spotify.csv" and "movie_reviews.csv" csv files in "Releases" section for download and testing.

*Important -> We need the "movie_review.csv" to test our Supervised Models. This csv file is over 25mb, due to this we decided to host the file as a public release. This method will allow users to download and access both of our testing csv files "Spotify.csv" and "movie_reviews.csv".
