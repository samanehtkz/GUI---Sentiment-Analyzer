# GUI---Sentiment-Analyzer
Our project is about making an app for sentiment analysis. Our users will, after logging in, will be able to upload a raw csv file in order to perform different analyses using unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms.
We would like to present the user tables and performance graphs between models.
After choosing the most suitable model, based on its accuracy and performance, the user will have the option to download the final analyzed csv file.
Finally, the user will log out his or her account.
